Have you ever wondered that the mail that you wrote, or the current text you are writing is not upto mark and you know what you want to write but it is difficult to articulate it?..
This is my problem since childhood that I get creative thoughts but when it comes to expressing them, It comes out bad and I cannot justify the correct essence of my thoughts.
Thanks to the LLMs, I can do this but it had one problem... whenever I used to write those mails, i had to go back to open.chatgpt.com or whatever it is and then tell it to paraphrase this also explaining it what intention it was meant to be. 
So finally i give up and since I am free, I thought to take the things in my hand. I saw some extensions but was not satisfied with them and since i know this isnt a big mountain (hoping), I thought I'll solve this myself.

Firsly, I'll use the Cohere generative model, because why not !! and I am a fan of it.

    - popup.html : 
    - styles.css
    - script.js


Let me know your suggestions, modifications or something that needs a fix. I'll be happy to help !!!
